## Reverse engineer board position


[5, 2, 6, 3, 8, 10, 9, 12, 11, 4, 8, 10, 9, 4, 5, 6, 3, 11]

- Catan has 19 hex tiles. 18 tiles are resources, 1 is a desert.
- There are 18 numbers that are placed in a spiral around the board
- The official algorithm for generating a board:
  1. Place 19 terrain tiles randomly on the board
  2. Place 9 harbor tiles randomly on the board
  3. Sort the 18 numbers, start at a corner, and place them in a spiral counter-clockwise, skipping over desert tiles


Combinations:
- orient the board from the perspective of the 5, removing symmetry
- step 1: 19! / (4! 4! 4! 3! 3!) = 244_432_188_000
- step 2: 9! / 4! = 15_120
- step 3: 19 ways to do this (there are 19 ways to skip over desert tiles

total:
= 244_432_188_000 * 15_120 * 19
= 70_220_478_968_640_000
= 7.022047896864 Ã— 10^16

Actually the answer is
3695814682560000
